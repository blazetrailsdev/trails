# The attribution guards in ci.yml run under `set -euo pipefail`, so a bare
# `gh api` turns a GitHub API blip into a red "Forbid Claude attribution"
# step — and the step name is the only thing a maintainer sees in the checks
# UI, so it reads as though attribution was actually found (see PR #4982,
# which died on an HTTP 503 with a single clean commit).
#
# Retrying indiscriminately would trade that for a different lie: a 404 or a
# 403 from a misconfigured token is permanent, and reporting it as "API
# unreachable" after 30s of pointless backoff misdirects just as badly. So
# classify first and only retry what can actually succeed on a retry.
#
# Payload goes to stdout; all diagnostics go to stderr, so callers can safely
# capture output in a command substitution without retry chatter polluting
# the text they are about to grep.

# Rate limiting is transient but must be matched on *wording*, not status:
# GitHub returns primary and secondary rate-limit errors as EITHER 403 or 429,
# and a bare 403 is otherwise permanent (a token missing a scope). Keying on
# the code alone would either retry real permission failures for minutes or —
# as originally written here — fail the guard instantly on a rate limit.

# GitHub asks callers to back off at least a minute on secondary limits, so
# rate-limit retries use their own (much longer) schedule than 5xx retries.
# They also get their own, smaller attempt cap: Preflight runs under
# `timeout-minutes: 10` and makes three of these calls, so a full 4-attempt
# schedule at 60s could exhaust the job budget and leave a bare "cancelled" —
# the same uninformative signal this script exists to prevent. Two waits per
# call bounds the worst case at ~6 min across all three.

 * Pulled out of extractStepLogs and covered by tests because getting it wrong
 * is silent: two runs of `compare.ts` that classify the same overwrite each
 * other in the step map (the later one in the job wins) and the losing step's
 * stats table quietly fills with the wrong run's numbers.

 * Historic flags and entry-point names are kept — the sync reparses job logs
 * going back to the start of the repo, so a rename must stay understood here
 * forever, not just until the next backfill.
